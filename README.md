## 📘 Project Overview

Welcome to the official repository for our CDE2310 System Design project — a fully autonomous robot capable of:

- 🌐 Frontier exploration and real-time mapping using Nav2
- 🌡️ Detecting heat sources with the AMG8833 thermal sensor
- 🚀 Launching projectiles via a custom flywheel system
- 🧠 Operating entirely within a ROS2-based simulation in Ignition Gazebo
