# The Challenge


## Problem Definition

This project aims to design and develop an autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating a maze-like environment, detecting heat sources, and engaging with them by performing a launch task. The robot simulates a deployed unit in a thermal response scenario, where it must autonomously locate and engage ‚Äúhot‚Äù targets placed throughout the maze.

The robot begins at a fixed starting point and must independently traverse a series of corridors, guided by onboard sensors and logic. Throughout the maze, cylindrical thermal sources simulate objects of interest in the mission environment, such as trapped individuals or overheated machinery.

To address this challenge, the robot integrates multiple core subsystems:

- A navigation system based on the ROS2 Nav2 stack and LDS LiDAR  
- A heat detection system built from dual AMG8833 infrared cameras  
- A custom projectile launcher powered by dual brushless flywheels  
- An onboard decision-making script that transitions between exploration, targeting, and engagement modes  

All modules are governed by a centralized controller that manages sensor fusion, state transitions, and real-time response. The system must operate under power and processing constraints typical of field-deployable mobile robots. The operational framework necessitates successful navigation through the environment within a **25-minute execution window**. This project thereby simulates a complete response pipeline, from exploration and detection to engagement.

An example of the maze is given below._

## Mission Objectives

### Core Objectives

The robot is designed to accomplish the following core objectives within a constrained arena environment:

1. **Autonomous Navigation**  
   The robot must independently traverse a maze-like arena without human input, using onboard LiDAR and the Nav2 ROS stack to perform real-time mapping, localization, and path planning. It must avoid obstacles, explore unmapped areas, and update its occupancy grid accordingly.

2. **Thermal Source Detection**  
   The robot uses two AMG8833 thermal cameras mounted at the front-left and rear-right. These sensors continuously scan their respective fields of view, returning 8√ó8 temperature grids. Upon detecting a reading above a defined threshold, the robot fuses LiDAR data to localize the heat source in world coordinates and stores it for later engagement.

3. **Targeted Launch Mechanism**  
   After the mapping phase, the robot sequentially navigates to detected thermal sources. At each location, it aligns itself and activates a dual-flywheel launcher to fire a ping pong ball toward the source. This simulates delivering a payload, aid package, or performing a mark or alert in a real-world operation.

4. **Full-System Integration**  
   All subsystems‚Äîthermal sensing, LiDAR navigation, actuation, and launching‚Äîare integrated through a centralized ROS2 node (`GlobalController`). This controller manages state transitions (e.g., Exploratory Mapping ‚Üí Goal Navigation ‚Üí Launching), task coordination, and fault recovery (e.g., ramp detection via IMU). The integration enables smooth and autonomous execution of the mission from start to finish.
